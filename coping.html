        <h1>Breathing Techniques </h1>
          <p>The University of Michigan wrote an article on December 15th, 2020 about <a href="https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/uz2255" class="identify"> breathing exercises</a> for stress management.A summary of their findings are these three techniques: Belly breathing, 4-7-8 breathing, and Roll breathing.The steps for each are straight from their website with the follow along instructions.</p>
            <h2> Belly Breathing </h2>
              <ol>
                <li>
                   Sit or lie flat in a comfortable position.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Put one hand on your belly just below your ribs and the other hand on your chest.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take a deep breath in through your nose, and let your belly push your hand out. Your chest should not move.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Do this breathing 3 to 10 times. Take your time with each breath.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h2>4-7-8 Breathing</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li> 
                      Start like you would for belly breathing with one hand on your belly and one hand on chest. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Take a deep, slow breath from your belly, and silently count to 4 as you breathe in. Hold your breath, and silently count from 1 to 7.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Breathe out completely as you silently count from 1 to 8. Try to get all the air out of your lungs by the time you count to 8.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Repeat 3 to 7 times or until you feel calm.
                    </li>
                </ol>
              <h2>Roll Breathing</h2>
                <ol class="writing ">
                    <li>
                      Start like you would for belly breathing with one hand on your belly and one hand on chest. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Practice filling your lower lungs by breathing so that your "belly" (left) hand goes up when you inhale and your "chest" (right) hand remains still. Always breathe in through your nose and breathe out through your mouth. Do this 8 to 10 times.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When you have filled and emptied your lower lungs 8 to 10 times, add the second step to your breathing: inhale first into your lower lungs as before, and then continue inhaling into your upper chest. Breathe slowly and regularly. As you do so, your right hand will rise and your left hand will fall a little as your belly falls.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      As you exhale slowly through your mouth, make a quiet, whooshing sound as first your left hand and then your right hand fall. As you exhale, feel the tension leaving your body as you become more and more relaxed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Practice breathing in and out in this way for 3 to 5 minutes. Notice that the movement of your belly and chest rises and falls like the motion of rolling waves.
                    </li>
                </ol>
